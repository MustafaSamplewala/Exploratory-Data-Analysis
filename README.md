# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
ðŸ“‹ Task Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset to understand the data using statistics and visualizations.

ðŸ›  Tools Used
Python

Pandas for data handling

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

NumPy for numerical operations

ðŸ“ˆ Steps Performed
Data Loading:

Loaded the Titanic dataset (Titanic-Dataset.csv) using Pandas.

Initial Exploration:

Displayed the first few rows.

Checked dataset information (data types, null values).

Summary Statistics:

Generated summary statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, etc.

Missing Values:

Identified missing values in columns.

Data Visualization:

Created histograms for all numerical features.

Created boxplots to detect outliers.

Plotted a correlation matrix heatmap for numerical features.

Created pairplots to explore relationships between features.

Plotted countplots for categorical variables.

Insights:

Females had a higher survival rate than males.

1st Class passengers had better survival chances.

'Fare' feature showed right-skewness (outliers present).

Negative correlation observed between Pclass and Fare.

ðŸ“‚ Files Included
Titanic-Dataset.csv â€” The dataset used.

ðŸ“Œ Important Notes
Only numerical columns were selected for correlation matrix to avoid conversion errors.

Skewness in data was detected through histogram plots.

Outliers were identified using boxplots.
